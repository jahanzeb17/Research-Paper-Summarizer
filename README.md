# üìö Research Paper Summarizer

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that allows you to upload research papers (PDF, TXT, DOCX) and generate customized summaries. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles, it provides flexible summarization options based on explanation style and length.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The project is built using the following key technologies:

* **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application interface.
* **LangChain**: A framework for developing applications powered by language models, used for document loading, text splitting, embeddings, and RAG chain construction.
* **PyMuPDFLoader**: For loading PDF documents.
* **TextLoader**: For loading plain text documents.
* **UnstructuredWordDocumentLoader**: For loading DOCX documents.
* **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**: For breaking down documents into manageable chunks.
* **OpenAI Embeddings**: For converting text chunks into vector representations.
* **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, used as the vector store.
* **ChatGroq**: For integrating with Groq's low-latency inference engine, utilizing the `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model for summarization.
* **python-dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
